# Django API Authentication and Profile Management

## Overview

This project is a Django-based authentication and profile management system with API endpoints. It includes functionalities such as:

- User registration with email verification
- User login with token authentication
- Profile management for users and viewers
- Password reset functionality

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: User login, registration, and authentication with Django Rest Framework (DRF) and token-based authentication.
- **Email Verification**: Users must confirm their email address before activating their account.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including usernames and email addresses.
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password via email verification.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```plaintext

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_PASSWORD=<your_redis_password>  # The password for Redis authentication
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1  # The hostname or IP address where Redis is running
REDIS_PORT=6379  # The port on which Redis is listening (default: 6379)
REDIS_DB=1  # The Redis database index (can be changed if needed)

# Email Backend Settings
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com  # Replace with your email provider
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com  # Replace with your email
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password  # Replace with your email password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Domain
DOMAIN_REDIRECT=http://localhost:4200  # Replace with your frontend domain
ROOT_DOMAIN=http://127.0.0.1:8000  # Replace with your backend domain

```

Ensure the `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent exposing credentials.

### 5. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
